# CIDOO QK61 Layout

This repo contains my personal layout files for the CIDOO QK61 V2 keyboard and some useful links to get started.


## Before you start

Before using the layout files from this repo, make sure that your keyboard has the exact Vendor ID and Product ID.
There are different ways how you can do it. I would use the Chrome browser because this is the easiest solution.
